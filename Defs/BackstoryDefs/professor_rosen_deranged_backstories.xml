        <description>The heir to a vast empire, [PAWN_nameDef] nearly caused a succession crisis when [PAWN_pronoun] disappeared for almost a year, as did a number of sentience catalysts.  When [PAWN_pronoun] returned, those closest to [PAWN_objective] were certain something was different, but they couldn't quite put their finger on it.</description>

    Spread out the following backstories among multiple cultist backstories.
    The archotech known as Horax is actually the high priest of another entity, ala Cthulhu. 
    That entity is "She Of the Cerulean Hair" and "Her of the Sibulant Voice."
    Horax went insane when he learned this entity was actually Hatsune Miku, a vocaloid program.
