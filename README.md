# Professor Rosen's Absolutely Deranged Backstories
![Preview Image](About/Preview.png "Preview")
## What?

This is a small collection of backstories and accompanying patches and traits that are unsuited for my primary backstory mod.
It will grow over time as I have more stupid ideas or people suggest additions.
Backstories suited for this mod, but not the other, are ones that:
- Break immersion
- Overpowered
- Absurd
- A joke that exists only for the sake of being a joke.

## Why?
Because I love the idea of the High Stellarch being three raccoons in a trenchcoat who have gotten too deep into the royal court to stop now.

## Dependencies?
None, but the backstories will use Combat Extended and Vanilla Traits Expanded if you have them.
