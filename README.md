# Professor Rosen's Absolutely Deranged Backstories
![Preview Image](About/Preview.png "Preview")
## What?

This is a small collection of backstories and accompanying patches and traits that are unsuited for my primary backstory mod.
It will grow over time as I have more stupid ideas or people suggest additions.
Backstories suited for this mod, but not the other, are ones that:
- Break immersion
- Are Overpowered
- Are Absurd

## Examples?

- The Stellarch is now three raccoons in an elaborate disguise.
- A minecraft player in the wrong game.
- A cleaner.

## Why?
Why not?

## Dependencies?
None.  Not even Harmony.  But the backstories will use Combat Extended and Vanilla Traits Expanded if you have them. 

## Compatibility?
Should be compatible with everything, unless some other mod out there is messing with the spawn pool for the Stellarch.
