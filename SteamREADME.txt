[h1]Professor Rosen's Absolutely Deranged Backstories[/h1]

[h2]What?[/h2]
This is a small collection of backstories and accompanying patches and traits that are unsuited for my primary backstory mod.
It will grow over time as I have more stupid ideas or people suggest additions.
Backstories suited for this mod, but not the other, are ones that:
[list]
[*] Break immersion
[*] Are Overpowered
[*] Are Absurd
[/list]

[h2]Examples?[/h2]
[list]
[*] The Stellarch is now three raccoons in an elaborate disguise.
[*] A minecraft player in the wrong game.
[*] A cleaner.
[/list]

[h2]Why?[/h2]
Why not?

[h2]Dependencies?[/h2]
None.  Not even Harmony.  But the backstories will use Combat Extended and Vanilla Traits Expanded if you have them. 

[h2]Compatibility?[/h2]
Should be compatible with everything, unless some other mod out there is messing with the spawn pool for the Stellarch.
